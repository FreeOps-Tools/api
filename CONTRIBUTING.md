## Issues & Pull Requests

### Creating an Issue

Before **creating** an Issue for `features`/`bugs`/`improvements` please follow these steps:

1. search existing issues before creating a new issue (probably someone raised this already)
1. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible (please select the correct Issue type, for example `bug` or `feature`)
1. all Issues are automatically given the label `status: waiting for triage`. Please wait until the maintainers review the Issue and update the labels
1. look out for when the Issue label changes to `status: ready for dev`
1. comment on the Issue asking for it to be assigned to you (do not tag maintainers as all maintainers receive your comment notifications)
1. **only** start working on this issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you - this will prevent confusion, multiple people working on the same issue and work not being used.

### Working on an Issue (get it assigned to you)

Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:

1. please do not ask to be assigned an issue that has the label `status: awaiting triage` - this creates more notifications for maintainers and it will not be assigned
1. look out for the Issue label `status: ready for dev` (if it does not have this label, your work might not be accepted)
1. comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you (do not tag any maintainers as all maintainers receive your comment notifications)
1. after the issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it
1. do **not** enable GitHub Actions on your fork
1. reference the Issue in your Pull Request (for example `closes #123`)

> Notes:
> - any issues that have no activity after 3 weeks will be unassigned and re-assigned to someone else
> - only request to be assigned an issue if you know how to work on it

### A step-by-step guide for first-time contributors

1. **Fork the repository:** Once an issue has been assigned to you, the next step is to fork the repository. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account that you can work on without affecting the original project.

2. **Clone the repository:** After forking the repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. This creates a local copy of the project that you can edit and modify.

3. **Create a new branch:** Before making any changes, create a new branch in your local repository. This allows you to work on your changes without affecting the main branch of the project.

4. **Make changes and commit them:** Once you have created a new branch, you can start making changes to the code. Make sure to write clean and clear code and follow any coding standards or guidelines set by the project maintainers. After making changes, commit them with a descriptive message explaining what you changed.

5. **Push changes to GitHub:** After committing your changes, push them to your forked repository on GitHub. This updates your forked repository with your changes.

6. **Create a pull request:** Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, you can create a pull request to submit your changes to the original project. Our project maintainers will review your changes and decide whether to merge them into the dev branch of this project.

7. **Address feedback:** If any project maintainers provide feedback on your changes, make sure to address their comments and suggestions. This may involve making further changes to your code and updating your pull request.

8. **Celebrate your contribution:** If your changes are accepted and merged into the main branch of the project, `congratulations!` You have made your first contribution to our open-source project. Celebrate your achievement and continue to contribute to this project or explore other open-source projects.


## Reviewing Pull Requests

We welcome everyone to review Pull Requests, it is a great way to learn and network.

### DOs
- be kind and respectful, we use inclusive, gender neutral language (for example `they/them` instead of `guy/man`)
- use inline comments to explain your suggestions
- use inline suggestions to propose changes

### DON'Ts
- don't be rude, disrespectful or aggressive
- do not repeat feedback, this creates more noise than value (check the existing conversation), use GitHub reactions if you agree/disagree with a comment
- do not blindly approve pull requests to improve your GitHub contributors graph
